# Changes (2026-02-10)

## Summary

This update focuses on:

- Restoring/adding the "expected" CI/CD functionality described in `README.md` (Tekton listener/pipelinerun correctness, show README task).
- Hardening the demo Node app against common correctness/security issues without reducing performance.
- Adding automated tests and a lightweight performance check to prevent regressions.
- Cleaning up repo hygiene around secrets and committed artifacts.

## Node App

- Refactored routing into an app factory (`app.js`) and made `server.js` a thin runtime entrypoint.
  - Rationale: enables dependency injection for testing and keeps runtime startup concerns separate.
- Added `/healthz` endpoint for basic readiness/liveness checks.
- Prevented stored XSS by escaping user-controlled fields when rendering `views/profile.html`.
- Added basic validation:
  - Missing required fields on `/register` return `400`.
  - Invalid ObjectId-like values on `/profile` and `/update` return `400` instead of bubbling errors.
- Updates now request validator enforcement via `{ runValidators: true }` for Mongoose updates.

Performance impact:

- Profile template is cached at startup to avoid per-request disk reads.

## Tests

- Added Node-native tests (`node:test`) under `tests/` with an in-memory fake model.
  - Rationale: avoids external services (Mongo) and avoids binding network ports in restricted CI/sandbox environments.
- `npm test` now runs the suite.

## Performance Check

- Added `npm run perf` (`perf/basic.js`) as a micro-benchmark for template rendering and HTML escaping.
  - Intended to catch accidental performance regressions (e.g., O(n^2) string work).

## Tekton / CI Manifests

- Moved manifests into a standard structure under `manifests/` (Tekton vs runtime Kubernetes).
- Fixed invalid EventListener YAML structure (`manifests/tekton/triggers/event-listener.yaml`) by placing `triggers` under `spec`.
- Updated PipelineRun to reference the existing pipeline (`manifests/tekton/runs/pipelinerun.yaml`).
- Updated the pipeline to actually run the `show-readme` task (`manifests/tekton/pipeline/pipeline.yaml`) and updated the Task to print a README (`manifests/tekton/tasks/show-readme.yaml`).
- Added persistent caching and scanning integration:
  - Cache PVC manifest: `manifests/tekton/pvc/cache-pvc.yaml` (claim `tekton-cache-pvc`)
  - Added cache workspace to TriggerTemplate + PipelineRun + Pipeline
  - Added in-repo tasks:
    - Trivy scan: `manifests/tekton/tasks/trivy-sca-scan.yaml`
    - NPM test: `manifests/tekton/tasks/npm-test.yaml`
    - SonarQube scan: `manifests/tekton/tasks/sonarqube-scan.yaml` (optional; needs `sonarqube-credentials` secret)
  - Triggered and manual PipelineRuns now set `serviceAccountName: tekton-triggers-sa`

## Secrets / Repo Hygiene

- Added a root `.gitignore` to prevent committing `node_modules/`, `.env`, and coverage artifacts.
- Added `.env.example` and updated Docker Compose to use `.env` interpolation.
- Sanitized secret manifests (`manifests/tekton/secrets/git-ssh-secret.yaml`, `manifests/tekton/secrets/docker-credentials.yaml`) to remove committed secret material from the working tree (history still needs rotation and rewriting if this was ever real).
- Stopped tracking `node_modules/` and `.env` in git (these should not live in the repository).
